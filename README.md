3. Secure Scheduler
Electronic calendars are very convenient for setting up appointments and then having them
accessible in multiple devices like smartphones and computers. However, there are privacy risks in
using them. Some personal information can also be leaked when setting an appointment with
another person or a group of people.
Design a solution to schedule meetings with privacy.
For increased usefulness, consider using actual calendar data â€“ Google Calendar, Outlook.com -
that can be accessed using APIs.
